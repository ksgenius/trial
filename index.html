          I still remember that day on December 2020, I opened Fiverr as was not
          able to access my seller account, my heart skipped a beat at that
          moment and I felt devastated, I tried to contact their service center
          but their reply was not convincing and ultimately I lost my account
          and my income was stopped completely.

          I was awful and despaired. After few days and after getting my tears
          up, I decided that "NO MATTER WHATS I AM GONNA MAKE IT AND WILL BE A

          gladly say that all paid off, after 2-3 weeks of networking, cold
          emailing and searching for freelancing opportunities, I got
          connecction with some few production hpuse, youtube channels and more
          coonections through which I got help to restart my carrier in
